This is a to-do list made entirely in vanilla JavaScript. It has a favourite option to highlight tasks the user has set great importance on. It uses a hidden design on the list elements when none exist to create a clean display for the user. The app also utilizes a checkbox system to mark off complete tasks.

There is a set of three options for the user select. These will display different sets of list items depending on what the user would like to see. There is also the option to delete individual items or to clear all tasks at once.
